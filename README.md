# JN_Honors_Program_Physics_Thesis_Mean_Neuronal_Firing_Rate_Hypothesis
This is the MATLAB code used for my Honors Thesis Physics Research Project while at Andrews University doing my bachelors in Electrical and Computer Engineering with math and physics minors. This research covers analyzing marmoset monkey neuron signal data using mutual information as a non-linear statistic to assess information content of signal time series. This code is what was used to perform the computations, create the plots, and perform the signal analysis found in the following white paper:

Research abstract: 

"
While it is currently well accepted that the mean neuronal firing rate (MNFR) is a key parameter encoding information about sensory and motor events, in some cases the measured information due to MNFR is not adequate to explain the total neuron signal information content. In this study, several auditory neuron responses and corresponding MNFR--generated surrogates are analyzed using mutual information (MI) as a metric of information content. Results showed that for particular inter-spike gaps (ISG), data MI exceeded two standard deviations of the surrogate MNFR MI, indicating spike spacing and order also encode information.
